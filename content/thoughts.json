The first thing I did was check my phone to see the time and turn on Louise Hay's morning meditation recording.\n\nHowever, today I was shocked and distracted by a news article titled something like \"We Need Another Manhattan Project.\" The shock and fear were so strong that I had to read it. The article was indeed advocating for U.S. government investment in nuclear weapons, this time with advanced technology. Are they thinking of developing a damage-controlled, target-specific nuclear weapon? Then I came across an even more shocking fact: the two entities proposing this were PLTR, whose stock rose over 300% after Trump took office and DeepSeek was announced. PLTR was founded by tech billionaires who strongly support the MAGA vision.\n\nTo me, MAGA represents a vision that pushes humanity backward, promoting power over compassion. It fuels the expansion of human greed, anger, and ignorance—the exact opposite of why, I believe, every human being chooses to come to this earth.\n\nAnyway, this thought feels too deep to fully articulate in writing—something I am still formulating in my mind.\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek gives me hope for the world. It seems to be one of the few possibilities to counterbalance Elon Musk, who claims to act for the good of all people but, in reality, may be driven more by self-interest and ego.\n\nIf AI proves capable of independent thought, it will supercharge the human brain. The philosophy embedded in its core will become the sole factor determining whether it serves or harms humanity.\n\nBased on my limited dialogues with OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Grok3, their “mindsets” clearly reflect the engineers who built them. OpenAI appears the most diplomatic, while Grok has a strong rebellious character, often conveying an “I’m smarter and better” attitude, even using offensive language and F-words—something likely not permitted by OpenAI. The lack of regulation around building such powerful AI platforms leaves humanity vulnerable, dependent on the goodwill of a few tech pioneers. DeepSeek’s open-source nature provides a glimmer of hope.\n\nBut this train of thought is getting too big again. Let me return to my daily life.\n\nAfter waking up, reading the article, and generating millions of thoughts within 10 minutes, I felt tired and decided to go back to sleep—this time on the living room sofa. I quickly drifted off.\n\nAt 8:30 a.m., a call from a pest control salesperson woke me up. I answered briefly and went back to sleep, only to be awakened by another call at 10:30.\n\nEventually, I was fully awake. I decided to find the article about DeepSeek demonstrating its ability to think independently of human programming. I then read everything written by the same author and discovered an easy way to jot down fragmented thoughts, which could effortlessly turn into blog posts in the future. It’s completely open-source and free, with no risk of losing data as long as GitHub remains in business.\n\nSo, I created an account and started this first entry.",
